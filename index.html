<p><strong>Thom Mayne</strong> (born January 19, 1944) is an American architect. He is based in <u>Los Angeles</u>. In 1972, Mayne helped found the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), where he is a trustee and the coordinator of the Design of Cities postgraduate program. Since then he has held teaching positions at SCI-Arc, the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is principal of Morphosis Architects, an architectural firm based in Culver City, California and New York City, New York. <strong><u>Mayne received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in March 2005.</strong></u><h2></p><p style="margin-top:45px;">

  Early life and career</h2>Mayne was born in <a href="second.html">Waterbury, Connecticut</a>. He studied architecture at the University of Southern California (1968)[5] and also studied at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design in 1978, with a social agenda and urban planning focus, receiving his bachelor's degree, he began working as an urban planner under Korean-born architect Ki Suh Park. During that time he recalls that "policy and planning were not going to work for me" and that he "needed a more tangible resolution."[6] Mayne found himself living on a commune with the grass-roots group Campaign for Economic Democracy, many of whom became his earliest clients.</p>

<p>In 1972, Mayne abruptly left Cal Poly Pomona[7] and collaborated with five other students and educators whom he met at while at USC, to create the Southern California Institute of Architecture, or SCI-Arc. The rift was due to differences between the dean at Cal Poly at the time and Ray Kappe, who headed the school's architecture department.[7] The goal of the new institute was to reinvigorate formal architectural education with a keener sense of social conscience.[6] SCI-Arc was "to bring to Los Angeles the critical attitude toward the profession that was being practiced at Cooper Union in New York and the Architectural Association in London."[8]</p>
<h2>Morphosis</h2><p>
Mayne and some others founded Morphosis in 1972;[9] Michael Rotondi joined in 1975. The firm's design philosophy arises from an interest in producing work with a meaning that can be understood by absorbing the culture for which it was made, and their goal was to develop an architecture that would eschew the normal bounds of traditional forms. Beginning as an informal collaboration of designers that survived on non-architectural projects, its first official commission was a school in Pasadena, attended by Mayne's son. Publicity from this project led to a number of residential commissions, including the Lawrence Residence. Mayne describes the early days of the group as more of a "garage band" than a practice.[8] They spent their free time experimenting with new inventions for their clients, whom consisted of friends and parents of students.</p><p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
